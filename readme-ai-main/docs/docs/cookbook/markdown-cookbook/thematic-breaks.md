# Line Separators in Markdown

Line separators are useful for visually dividing sections of your document. In Markdown, you can create line separators using either Markdown syntax or HTML.

## Markdown Horizontal Rule

You can create a horizontal rule in Markdown using three or more hyphens, asterisks, or underscores:

```markdown
---
```

or

```markdown
***
```

Both of these will render as:

---

## HTML Horizontal Rule

For more control over the appearance of your horizontal rule, you can use HTML:

```html
<hr>
```

This will render as:

<hr>

You can style the HTML horizontal rule using inline CSS for more customization:

```html
<hr style="border: 2px solid #333;">
```

This will render as:

<hr style="border: 2px solid #333;">

## Best Practices

1. Use horizontal rules sparingly to avoid cluttering your document.
2. Be consistent in your choice of syntax (Markdown or HTML) throughout your document.
3. Consider using headers instead of horizontal rules for major section breaks.

By using line separators effectively, you can improve the readability and structure of your Markdown documents.
