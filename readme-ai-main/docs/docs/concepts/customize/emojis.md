## Technical Details

!!! info "Emoji Integration"

    Emoji prefixes are added to headers while maintaining clean anchor links for GitHub compatibility. This includes:

    - Converting headers to lowercase.
    - Replacing spaces with hyphens.
    - Removing special characters.

!!! tip "Best Practices"

    - Use **Minimal** or **Default** themes for formal documentation.
    - Choose **OSS** for open source projects.
    - Select **API** for technical API documentation.

## Advanced Usage

Combine emoji themes with other ReadmeAI features for customized documentation:

```bash
readmeai --emojis oss \
         --navigation-style bullet \
         --header-style modern \
         --repository https://github.com/username/project
```

<!--
### Creating Custom Themes

You can create custom themes by adding them to your configuration:

> [🚧 WORK IN PROGRESS] - Feature currently under development.

[themes.custom]
name = "Custom Theme"
description = "Your custom theme description"

[[themes.custom.sections]]
title = "📚 Table of Contents"

[[themes.custom.sections]]
title = "🎯 Overview"
# ... add more sections


## Tips and Tricks

1. **Theme Testing**
```sh
readmeai --emojis <theme> --dry-run
```

2. **Custom Theme Creation**
```sh
readmeai --emojis custom --theme-file path/to/theme.toml
```

3. **Section Override**
```sh
readmeai --emojis <theme> --no-emoji-sections "overview,features"
```

!!! tip "Tip: Theme Preview"
Use the `--preview` flag to see how your README will look with different themes before generating.

!!! warning "Platform Compatibility"
Some platforms or markdown renderers may display emojis differently. Always test your documentation's  -->
