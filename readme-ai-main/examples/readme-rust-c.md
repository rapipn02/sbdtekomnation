##  Features

|    |   Feature         | Description |
|----|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| ‚öôÔ∏è  | **Architecture**  | The project is structured with a Rust module for kernel interactions and a GUI component for user interface management. The architecture emphasizes system monitoring and process management at a kernel level. |
| üî© | **Code Quality**  | The codebase maintains a high level of quality with consistent style formatting using tools like `rustfmt`. It also follows best practices for Windows driver development, ensuring readability and maintainability. |
| üìÑ | **Documentation** | The project includes detailed documentation within the codebase outlining the functionalities of each module. However, external documentation could be enhanced for easier onboarding and understanding of the project. |
| üîå | **Integrations**  | Key integrations include Rust for kernel-level interactions, WinAPI for Windows-specific functionality, and Visual C++ for GUI development. External dependencies include 'toml' and 'rc'. |
| üß© | **Modularity**    | The codebase is modular, with separate modules for driver functionality and GUI components. This design promotes code reusability and ease of maintenance for specific functionalities. |
| üß™ | **Testing**       | Testing frameworks and tools used are not explicitly mentioned in the repository contents. Adding testing frameworks like `cargo test` could enhance code reliability and robustness. |
| ‚ö°Ô∏è  | **Performance**   | Efficiency and speed are prioritized in the project, especially in kernel interactions for system call monitoring and process management. Resource usage is optimized for better performance. |
| üõ°Ô∏è | **Security**      | Security measures for data protection and access control are not explicitly mentioned in the repository contents. Implementing secure coding practices and access control mechanisms would enhance the security of the project. |
| üì¶ | **Dependencies**  | Key external libraries and dependencies include 'rust', 'toml', 'rc', 'c', 'Cargo.toml', 'rs', and 'h' for various functionalities like kernel interactions, GUI development, and Windows driver management. |
| üöÄ | **Scalability**   | The project demonstrates potential scalability by focusing on system monitoring and process management at a kernel level. Additional optimizations can be made to handle increased traffic and load effectively. |
